# 📈 Stock Price Prediction Using Python and ML

This repository contains a Machine Learning (ML) model for predicting stock prices based on historical data. The model is built using **TensorFlow/Keras** and **scikit-learn** for data preprocessing.

## 📌 Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling)
- Data visualization (correlation heatmap, stock price trends)
- ML-based stock price prediction model
- Train and test dataset split
- Model evaluation using RMSE
- Predicting stock prices for the next 28 days
- Visualizing actual vs predicted stock prices

## 🛠️ Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries.

### **1️⃣ Clone the repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction-python-ml.git
cd stock-price-prediction-python-ml
```

### **2️⃣ Install dependencies**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is the **NSE-TATAGLOBAL** stock prices dataset, which is loaded from an online source:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwitiderrick/stockprice/master/NSE-TATAGLOBAL.csv
```

## 🚀 Usage
Run the script to train the model and visualize predictions:
```sh
python stock_price_prediction.py
```

## 📊 Model Architecture
The ML model consists of:
- **Data preprocessing and feature scaling**
- **ML algorithms for stock price prediction**
- **Evaluation metrics such as RMSE**

## 📉 Results
- RMSE for training and testing data is calculated
- A plot is generated showing:
  - Actual stock prices
  - Predicted stock prices for training & test data
  - Future predicted stock prices (28 days ahead)
